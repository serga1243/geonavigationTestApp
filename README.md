# geonavigationTestApp
One of my student projects in the Matlab language, where I created this application in appDesigner.
 It was created to test the filtering system by the Kalman method of signals from the global satellite navigation system. A .mat file is imported, which contains the coordinates of the trajectory of an object with equal sampling time. Then the satellite error is set for each coordinate and these coordinates are filtered in the form of an ephemeris. The filtering error is observed in the form of graphs.
